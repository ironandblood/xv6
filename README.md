This is an implementation of XV6 operating system, as the project of Course Operating System, Fudan University, 2022 Autumn.

### About XV6
xv6 is modeled on Dennis Ritchie’s and Ken Thompson’s Unix Version 6 (v6). xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented in ANSI C for a multi-core RISC-V. Read `xv6-book-riscv-rev2.pdf` in the root directory for more detailed information.

### About our project
There are 6 labs in our project, the implementation of each lab is in the corresponding directory under the `labx` directory. All codes are well documented(doge) and there should be no difficulty reading and understanding them.(I suppose.)  
Description of each lab is in the corresponding directory under the `labx` directory.  
You can read our report in the corresponding directory of this project, which contains the detailed information about our project and explains about our design about the xv6 operating system and test cases.

### Useful suggestions
- Read the book carefully before you start coding.
- Follow the instructions in the lab directory and finish the lab step by step.

### Hope you enjoy the project and have fun!
